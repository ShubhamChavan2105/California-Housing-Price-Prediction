# California-Housing-Price-Prediction

## Objective
The project aims to predict housing prices in California using machine learning models while analyzing the impact of socioeconomic and geographic factors such as median income, house attributes, and proximity to the ocean. The insights are designed to aid policymakers and real estate investors in making informed decisions regarding urban planning and investments.

## Overview
This project utilizes the "California Housing Prices" dataset from Kaggle to explore and model the factors influencing housing prices. The dataset includes key features such as median house values, demographic details, house attributes, and geographic proximity to the ocean. Three models—Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—are implemented to uncover the complex relationships between these variables and housing prices. Random Forest outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and reliability, effectively capturing non-linear and interactive effects among predictors.

The study highlights the strong influence of median income and ocean proximity on housing prices. Advanced data exploration techniques, including descriptive statistics and correlation analysis, were used to identify significant predictors and trends. The models were evaluated using metrics like R-squared, MAE, and RMSE to ensure robust performance.

## Conclusion
The analysis confirms that socioeconomic factors such as median income and geographic elements like ocean proximity significantly affect housing prices in California. The Random Forest model's superior performance underscores the complexity of housing market dynamics and the need for robust predictive tools. Future work could involve incorporating additional variables, such as environmental factors or property conditions, and leveraging advanced AI methods to further refine predictions and provide real-time insights for stakeholders.
